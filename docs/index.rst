Description
-----------

**plume** (**plu**gin **me**chanism) allows Earth System models to load plugins dynamically. **plume** offers APIs for controlling the loading mechanism and transferring data from the model to the plugins. A plugin can read input data generated by the model and implement specific calculations and analysis, providing a high-level of modularity and flexibility.

Architecture
------------

**plume** features 3 major components:

 * Plugin Manager: that controls the loading mechanism at runtime
 * Plugin Data: data transferred from the application to the plugin
 * Plugin: a dynamically-loadable plugin that implement specific calculations/algorithms

Plume offers API to this mechanism, available in multiple languages (currently C, C++ and Fortran)
